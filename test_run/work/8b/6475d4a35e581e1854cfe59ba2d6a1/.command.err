Welcome to mSigHdp mutational signature extraction pipeline. For any questions, please consort the original paper (Liu et al. 2023, https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqad005), GitHub/manual: (https://github.com/steverozen/mSigHdp/blob/v2.1.2-branch/mSigHdp_2.1.2.pdf), or the Stratton group. 

You have selected Analysis - please note that this is intended to be run on Lustre as it requires 20 CPUs.
